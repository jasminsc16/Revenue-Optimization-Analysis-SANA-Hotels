# Revenue Optimization Analysis - SANA Hotels

## Project Background

SANA Hotels, a Portuguese hotel chain founded in 1999, owns and operates the Myriad By SANA Hotels (a city hotel) and the EPIC SANA Algarve Hotel (a resort hotel). Collaborating with the Director of Revenue Management, I conduct an analysis to optimize revenue performance, reduce cancellation costs, and improve distribution channel profitability to inform recommendations to Finance, Marketing, and Operations teams. Using recorded booking transactions, this project explores revenue management, booking cancellation rate, direct booking strategy, and guest segmentation characteristics.

Insights and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:

•	Revenue Management and Pricing Strategy Analysis: An evaluation of ADR (average daily rate), RevPAR (revenue per available room), and pricing patterns across market segments, distribution channels, room types, and seasonal periods to identify revenue optimization opportunities.

•	Booking Cancellation Rate and Risk Mitigation: An analysis of cancellation patterns by guest segment, lead time, deposit type, and booking channel to quantify lost revenue and identify high-risk booking characteristics. 

•	Distribution Channel Performance and Direct Booking Strategy Analysis: An assessment of booking volume, revenue contribution, and guest behavior across Direct, Corporate, and Online TA channels to evaluate commission costs and direct booking conversion opportunities.

•	Guest Segmentation Characteristics: An evaluation of guest profiles based on customer type, repeat behavior, length of stay, special requests, and spending patterns to identify high-value segments and personalization opportunities.
